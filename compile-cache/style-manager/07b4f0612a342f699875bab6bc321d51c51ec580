This means you should stop using `:host` and `::shadow` pseudo-selectors, and prepend all your syntax selectors with `syntax--`. To prevent breakage with existing style sheets, Atom will automatically upgrade the following selectors:\n\n* `atom-text-editor.is-focused::shadow ruler-view.rulerz` => `atom-text-editor.is-focused.editor ruler-view.rulerz`\n\nAutomatic translation of selectors will be removed in a few release cycles to minimize startup time. Please, make sure to upgrade the above selectors as soon as possible."}
